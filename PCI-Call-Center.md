	1. Call recording key facts
		a. The PCI DSS guidelines do apply to your business if it takes card payments by phone and records its calls. 
		b. These guidelines have been put in place to protect your customers’ card data and to reduce the risk of credit card fraud. 
			i. It is a customer centric measure and of course, happy customers stick around, so ultimately, PCI DSS can be good for your business. 
		c. The PCI DSS guidelines specify that after a payment has been authorized, the sensitive authentication data (i.e. CVV, CV2) cannot be stored in any format. 
			i. This means not in stored data files, not in recorded calls, not in a spreadsheet, not in an email and not scribbled down on paper while taking a call. 
		d. If you store the PAN then you need to ensure it’s encrypted. However, encrypting the CVV is not acceptable – you simply can’t store it at all. 
		e. The PCI DSS guidelines don’t say that agents cannot be involved in taking a card payment over the phone. 
			i. PCI does recommend that you should consider ways of preventing an agent who takes card payments by phone from being able to see sensitive card data on their screen.
		f. There is no specific approved method for making your business’ call recordings PCI DSS compliant. There are several ways to meet the guidelines but you will need to choose what works best for your business.
